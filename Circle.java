/*Write a class called Circle that contains instance data that represents the circleâ€™s radius.
Define the Circle constructor to accept and initialize the radius, and include getter and setter methods
 for the radius. Include methods that calculate and return the circumference and area of the sphere.
 Include a toString method that returns a one-line description of the circle.
 Create a driver class called MultiCircle, whose
main method instantiates and updates several Circle objects. [Circumference = 2pr and Area = pr2].
